# iOSKeyboardEscapeKeyEnabler

iOS keyboards have a home key in place of an escape key, this tool enables the key to funcation as an escape key. [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) is unable to read this key, in fact Karabiner-Elements-12.1.0 causes this tool not to function.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

`brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnicolson/iOSKeyboardEscapeKeyEnabler/master/ioskeyboardescapekeyenabler.rb`

The following command will run the tool automatically:

`brew services start ioskeyboardescapekeyenabler`

Alternatively, you can run `iOSKeyboardEscapeKeyEnabler`  (or `iOSKeyboardEscapeKeyEnabler&` to run in the background) from the terminal.

## Compiling

The following command will manually compile the binary:

`clang -framework IOKit -framework Carbon iOSKeyboardEscapeKeyEnabler.c -o iOSKeyboardEscapeKeyEnabler`
